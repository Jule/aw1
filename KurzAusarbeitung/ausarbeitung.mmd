# Thematic overview

As modern embedded applications evolve, their performance requirements increase. Due to the limitations of embedded platforms, such as constraints in power consumption and heat dissipation, these increased performance requiresments cannot be met by simply increasing processor clock rates. As a result, modern embedded processors, such as the Dual Core Cortex-A9 shipped on the Xilinx Zynq platform, do not only include more than a single core, but also provide support for hardware level parallelism, for example by using "Single Instruction - Multiple Data" (SIMD) techniques.
