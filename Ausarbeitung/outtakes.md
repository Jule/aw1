# Intro

As modern embedded applications evolve, their performance requirements increase. Due to the limitations of embedded platforms, such as constraints in power consumption and heat dissipation, these increased performance requirements cannot be met by increasing processor clock rates.

Consequently, modern embedded platforms increasingly feature more than a single processing core, thus offering high-performance computing capabilities, while preservering low-power consumption constraints <!--\citep{Wang2013}-->.

# Stuff that provides parallelism

* E.g. on a relatively high level, one can use threads
* But there are also things like GPUs, SIMD etc
