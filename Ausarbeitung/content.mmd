# Introduction

As modern embedded applications evolve, their performance requirements increase. Due to the limitations of embedded platforms, such as constraints in power consumption and heat dissipation, these increased performance requirements cannot be met by increasing processor clock rates. Consequently, modern embedded processors, such as the Dual Core ARM Cortex-A9 shipped on the Xilinx Zynq platform, do not only feature more than a single processing core, but also provide support for hardware level parallelism.

In this essay, a number of techniques that allow the exploitation of different parallelism concepts will be explained. Additionally, their importance in the context of embedded application development will be evaluated based on current research.





# Stuff that provides parallelism

* E.g. on a relatively high level, one can use threads
* But there are also things like GPUs, SIMD etc


# Techniques

* Mention GPU stuff (OpenCL) somewhere

## Pipeline Pattern

## SIMD
